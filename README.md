# Project-E-608
This open-source Windows-based application will provide users with a seamless way to embed Closed Caption (CC) 
metadata into .MOV video files in the E608 SCC format, which is commonly used for TV broadcast. Additionally, 
it will enable users to convert raw .WAV audio files into transcribed .TXT files with timestamps, which can be 
edited and converted into the SCC format for embedding captions into video files. This tool aims to simplify 
the captioning process for media producers, content creators, and broadcasters.
